Materials for a data science setup workshop for Brown NSGP and GPP.

Lecture slides are given as a PDF. The `reference` directory includes markdown files with some 
further background on specific topics.

There are two companion repos for exercises:
- Exercise 1: [Linear regression demo](https://github.com/brownritt/nsgp_data_science_ex1)
- Exercise 2: [Git practice repo](https://github.com/brownritt/nsgp_data_science_ex1)

## Installation

By clicking on the green `Code` button, you can select an option to download the entire repo as a ZIP file. 
However, if your system is setup with git, you should use git to clone the repo, using the appropriate URL in
